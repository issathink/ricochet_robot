# Ricochet Robot

Authors:
Issa & Victor


This is an 'implementation' of Richet Robot (Rasende Roboter).
You'll find in this repo the source code of the a 'server' written in C and a 'client' written in Java with a nice GUI. It's a special implementation cause the server can handle only one game at a time and as much clients as you want (we know its kind of weird, you can launch multiple server instances to make it handle more games).
They communicate using a specific protocol that we will explain later.


I don't know for Victor but you can use this code.
